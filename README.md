## Classic Frogger

### Project Overview
This project is part of the Grow With Google FEND Program From Udacity. The goal is to recreate the classic arcade game  "Frogger" using HTML5 Canvas, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Instructions
 You control the player and must cross to the other side without colliding with the bugs. Any collision with an enemy will bring the player to the initial position. You control the player using the left, right, up and down arrow keys on your keyboard.

## How to play
You can clone this repo and run it using your local machine. You can also play online by visiting the following [link] (https://josedaniel0227.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/)
